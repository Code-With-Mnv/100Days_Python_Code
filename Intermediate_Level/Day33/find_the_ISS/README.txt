Gonna learn about passing the parameters in APIs

Not all the APIs allow us to pass some parameters, but some does.

Like a SUNRISE-SUNSET API which asks for location's latitude and longitude as parameters to return the sunrise and sunset timings.

We are continuing this concept to extend this simple code to get notified via email when it's night and ISS is right above our head.
